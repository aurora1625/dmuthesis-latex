	in which the basis vectors of F are constrained to be convex combinations
	of the data points. This is used for a kernel extension of NMF. We
	provide algorithms for computing these new factorizations and we
	provide supporting theoretical analysis. We also analyze the relationships

	implications for sparseness of solutions. Finally, we present experimental

  abstract = {Is perception of the whole based on perception of its parts? There
	is psychological and physiological evidence for parts-based representations
	in the brain, and certain computational theories of object recognition
	rely on such representations. But little is known about how brains
	or computers might learn the parts of objects. Here we demonstrate
	an algorithm for non-negative matrix factorization that is able to
	learn parts of faces and semantic features of text. This is in contrast
	to other methods, such as principal components analysis and vector
	quantization, that learn holistic, not parts-based, representations.
	Non-negative matrix factorization is distinguished from the other
	methods by its use of non-negativity constraints. These constraints
	lead to a parts-based representation because they allow only additive,
	not subtractive, combinations. When non-negative matrix factorization
	is implemented as a neural network, parts-based representations emerge
	by virtue of two properties: the firing rates of neurons are never
	negative and synaptic strengths do not change sign.},

  abstract = {Compared to singular value decomposition (SVD), generalized low-rank
	approximations of matrices (GLRAM) can consume less computation time,
	obtain higher compression ratio, and yield competitive classification
	performance. GLRAM has been successfully applied to applications
	such as image compression and retrieval, and quite a few extensions
	have been successively proposed. However, in literature, some basic
	properties and crucial problems with regard to GLRAM have not been
	explored or solved yet. For this sake, we revisit GLRAM in this paper.
	First, we reveal such a close relationship between GLRAM and SVD
	that GLRAM's objective function is identical to SVD's objective function
	except the imposed constraints. Second, we derive a lower bound of
	GLRAM's objective function, and discuss when the lower bound can
	be touched. Moreover, from the viewpoint of minimizing the lower
	bound, we answer one open problem raised by Ye (Machine Learning,
	2005), i.e., a theoretical justification of the experimental phenomenon
	that, under given number of reduced dimension, the lowest reconstruction
	error is obtained when the left and right transformations have equal
	number of columns. Third, we explore when and why GLRAM can perform
	well in terms of compression, which is a fundamental problem concerning
	the usability of GLRAM.},

  abstract = {The instantaneous noise-free linear mixing model in independent component
	analysis is largely a solved problem under the usual assumption of
	independent nongaussian sources and full column rank mixing matrix.
	However, with some prior information on the sources, like positivity,
	new analysis and perhaps simplified solution methods may yet become
	possible. In this letter, we consider the task of independent component
	analysis when the independent sources are known to be nonnegative
	and well grounded, which means that they have a nonzero pdf in the
	region of zero. It can be shown that in this case, the solution method
	is basically very simple: an orthogonal rotation of the whitened
	observation vector into nonnegative outputs will give a positive
	permutation of the original sources. We propose a cost function whose
	minimum coincides with nonnegativity and derive the gradient algorithm
	under the whitening constraint, under which the separating matrix
	is orthogonal. We further prove that in the Stiefel manifold of orthogonal
	matrices, the cost function is a Lyapunov function for the matrix
	gradient flow, implying global convergence. Thus, this algorithm

  abstract = {We propose a novel nonnegative matrix factorization model that aims
	at finding localized, part-based, representations of nonnegative
	multivariate data items. Unlike the classical nonnegative matrix
	factorization (NMF) technique, this new model, denoted "nonsmooth
	nonnegative matrix factorization" (nsNMF), corresponds to the optimization
	of an unambiguous cost function designed to explicitly represent
	sparseness, in the form of nonsmoothness, which is controlled by
	a single parameter. In general, this method produces a set of basis
	and encoding vectors that are not only capable of representing the
	original data, but they also extract highly localized patterns, which
	generally lend themselves to improved interpretability. The properties
	of this new method are illustrated with several data sets. Comparisons
	to previously published methods show that the new nsNMF method has
	some advantages in keeping faithfulness to the data in the achieving
	a high degree of sparseness for both the estimated basis and the
	encoding vectors and in better interpretability of the factors.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we present a regularization technique to extend recently
	proposed matrix learning schemes in learning vector quantization
	(LVQ). These learning algorithms extend the concept of adaptive distance
	measures in LVQ to the use of relevance matrices. In general, metric
	learning can display a tendency towards oversimplification in the
	course of training. An overly pronounced elimination of dimensions
	in feature space can have negative effects on the performance and
	may lead to instabilities in the training. We focus on matrix learning
	in generalized LVQ (GLVQ). Extending the cost function by an appropriate
	regularization term prevents the unfavorable behavior and can help
	to improve the generalization ability. The approach is first tested
	and illustrated in terms of artificial model data. Furthermore, we
	apply the scheme to benchmark classification data sets from the UCI
	Repository of Machine Learning. We demonstrate the usefulness of
	regularization also in the case of rank limited relevance matrices,
	i.e., matrix learning with an implicit, low-dimensional representation
	of the data.},
